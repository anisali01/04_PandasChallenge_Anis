# 04_PandasChallenge_Anis

Update 10/16/20: I used a lot of assistance from the instructors code to finish this activity toward the end where it required me to find variables with the groupby command. I was not entirely comfortable with it but I did learn a lot from the work I did by studying the code.

Update 10/13/2020
I haven't completed this activity yet. I will hopefully be done in 24-48 hours.

Analysis by Anis Ali of Heroes of Pymoli

From the data I can conclude that 84% of my population playing is male. Males also make the most amount of purchases which is obvious but, females have a higher average purchase price. The most popular age range of our population is 20-24 with 15-29 covering almost the majority of players of the game.
